# Volk 3D - Love2D Raycast Demo

This is a raycasting demo for Love2D, which hopefully I'll eventually turn into a full Wolfenstein 3D clone, called Volk 3D (because of the "Wolf" in "Wolfenstein", and "volk" is how the word for "wolf" is pronounced in Russian).

## Controls

- WSAD: movement

- left/right arrow keys: turning

- m: toggle map

- t: toggle texture mapping mode (WIP)

- q/escape: quit

## Running

Simply download the files, place them in a directory, and run `love <dir>`
